# TODO
## Defects
+ [x] It's too easy to stack-overflow python's parser with deeply nested
      subexprs (major; maybe fixable using the `ast` module)
+ [ ] There isn't any type inference yet
+ [ ] Parsing BlendScript requires a big boost in stack size (minor)
+ [ ] BlendScript is too slow for large (>700LOC) designs


## Features
+ [ ] Boolean modifiers/CSG
+ [ ] Curves and shape extrusions
+ [ ] Armatures
  + [ ] Bones
  + [ ] IK constraints
  + [ ] Pole targets
